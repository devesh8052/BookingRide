# BookingRide Application

This is project for simple application for booking ride for  users. I created  different endpoints for entering user and driver details and user can hit endpoint with approprite request to find available  rides and choose ride.
I created a singleton class for data storing purpose and data is shared throughout every service to get data It ensures to have only one object for data.
while  building this project I have also considered to make  driver busy if user chooses one  driver. one driver  can  ride only one user throughout application.
Please check controller and service layer to get more details.
